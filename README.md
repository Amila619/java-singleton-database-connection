# Java Singleton Database Connection

This repository demonstrates how to implement a singleton pattern for managing database connections in Java. The singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the database connection exists throughout the application's lifecycle.

## Features

- Thread-safe singleton implementation
- Centralized database connection management
- Two branches available:
    - `main`: Basic singleton implementation
    - `thread-safe`: Enhanced for multi-threaded environments
- Example usage included

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- JDBC driver for your database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-singleton-database-connection.git
    ```
2. Update the database connection details in the singleton class.
3. Build and run your Java application.
